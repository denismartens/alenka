			<h4> A few facts: </h4>
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li> I am a small town girl who was born and raised in the Republic of Belarus. </li> 
				<li> I made America my home in 2003 when i came here for college majoring in History. Having moved to the USA by myself at such an early age has made me a strong person and I now know how to turn life’s lemons into lemonade. </li>
