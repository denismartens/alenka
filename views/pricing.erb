		<p>
			Families are my specialty! There is nothing that takes my breath away more than making beautiful family images for you to keep. 
			My session price is all-inclusive, which means you will receive all fully-edited, digital images which typically result in at least 50 images.
			I select images myself and hand edit all of them. I usually finish images within 2 weeks.  
			March through October are popular months so please book sessions 1-2 months in advance.
